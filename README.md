# CELLRV32 Core Verification using RISCOF

1. [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites)
2. [Setup Configuration](#Setup-Configuration)
3. [Device-Under-Test (DUT)](#Device-Under-Test-DUT)

This repository is a port of the "**RISCOF** RISC-V Architectural Test Framework" to test the
[CELLRV32 RISC-V Processor](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32/tree/main) for compatibility to the RISC-V
user and privileged ISA specifications. **Sail RISC-V** is used as reference model.
Currently, the following tests are supported:

- [x] `rv32i_m\B` - bit-manipulation (`Zba`, `Zbb`, `Zbc`, `Zbs`)
- [x] `rv32i_m\C` - compressed instructions
- [x] `rv32i_m\I` - base integer ISA
- [x] `rv32i_m\M` - hardware multiplication and division
- [x] `rv32i_m\privilege` - privileged machine architecture
- [x] `rv32i_m\Zifencei` - instruction stream synchronization

:bulb: The general structure of this repository was setup according to the
[RISCOF installation guide](https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).


## Prerequisites

Several tools and submodules are required to run this port of the architecture test framework. The repository's
GitHub [Actions workflow](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)
takes care of installing all the required packages.

* [cellrv32](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32/tree/main) submodule - the device under test (DUT)
* [riscv-arch-test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) submodule - architecture test cases
* [RISC-V GCC toolchain](https://github.com/stnolting/riscv-gcc-prebuilt) - for compiling native `rv32` code
* [Sail RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv) - the reference model (pre-built binary in the[`bin`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof/tree/main/bin) folder)
* [RISCOF](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscof) - the architecture test framework
* QUESTASIM - the _awesome_ SystemVerilog simulator for simulating the DUT

The framework (running all tests) is invoked via a single shell script
[`run.sh`](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32-riscof/blob/master/run.sh) that returns 0 if all tests were executed
successfully or 1 if there were _any_ errors. The exit code of this script is used to determine the overall success
of the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Setup Configuration

The RISCOF [config.ini](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32-riscof/blob/master/config.ini) is used to configure
the plugins to be used: the device-under-test ("DUT") and the reference model ("REF").
The ISA, debug and platform specifications, which define target-specific configurations like available ISA
extensions, ISA spec. versions and platform modules (like MTIME), are defined by `YAML` files in the according
plugin folder.

* DUT: `cellrv32` in [`plugin-cellrv32`](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32-riscof/tree/master/plugin-cellrv32)
* REF: `sail_cSim` in [`plugin-sail_cSim`](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32-riscof/tree/master/plugin-sail_cSim)

Each plugin folder also provides low-level _environment_ files like linker scripts (to generate an executable
matching the target's memory layout) and platform-specific code (for example to initialize the target and
to dump the final test signatures/results).

The official [RISC-V architecture tests](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) repository
provides test cases for all (ratified) RISC-V ISA extensions (user and privilege ISA). Each test case checks
a single instruction or core feature and is compiled into a plugin-specific executable
using a [prebuilt RISC-V GCC toolchain](https://github.com/stnolting/riscv-gcc-prebuilt).

The "golden" reference data is generated by the **Sail RISC-V Model**. This data is compared against the
results of the DUT. The final test report is made available as CSS-flavored HTML file.

:bulb: Prebuilt _sail-riscv_ binaries for 64-bit Linux are available in the
[`bin`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-riscof/tree/main/bin) folder.

## Device-Under-Test (DUT)

The [`sim`](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32-riscof/tree/master/sim) folder provides a simple VHDL testbench
and shell scripts to simulate the CELLRV32 processor using **QUESTASIM**. The testbench provides generics to configure the
DUT's RISC-V ISA extensions and also to pass a plain ASCII HEX file, which represents the actual executable
to be executed ("memory initialization file"). This file generated from a test-specific ELF file that is compiled
by the folder's makefile. The makefile uses the default software framework from the CELLRV32 submodule (more
specific: the image generator) to generate a memory initialization file from a compiled ELF file.

:books: The "simulation mode" feature of the processor's UART0 module is used to _dump_ the test result data
(= the _test signature_) to a file. More information regarding the UART simulation mode can be found in the CELLRV32 documentation.

The testbench also provides a "trigger mechanism" to quit the current simulation using VHDL08's `finish`
statement. Quitting the simulation is triggered by writing `0xCAFECAFE` to address `0xF0000000`, which
is implemented (software) by the DUT-specific plugin environment module.

The simulation scripts and the makefile for generating the memory initialization file are invoked from a DUT-
specific Python script in the DUT's plugin folder
(-> [`plugin-cellrv32/riscof_cellrv32.py`](https://github.com/DatNguyen97-VN/cellrv32-riscof/blob/master/plugin-cellrv32/riscof_cellrv32.py)).
This Python script makes extensive use of shell commands to move and execute files and scripts.
